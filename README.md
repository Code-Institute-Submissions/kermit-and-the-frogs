# Kermit and the Frogs

Kermit and the Frogs have been a worldwide sensation ever since the release of their album 'Down on the Street' earlier this year. Their universal style and ethnic blends have created an unprecendented demand for their music, as age groups all over the world arr clamoring for content. Thus, this project was born.

People from all over world need somewhere to go to easily access the heralded music of Kermit and the Frogs, and this site does just that. It's a go to hub for all of their social links, newsletter signup, updates on shows, music samples, and even member bios so people can learn more about their favorite band.

## UX

This site is specifically for fans of Kermit and the Frogs who want easy access to their music. It should be easy and uncomplicated to find, visually appealing, and informative.

To get some ideas of concepts, I referenced one of my favorite artist's site, Jon Bellion: [Jon Bellion's Website](http://www.jonbellion.com/)

I appreciate the site's uniform design, fixed background image, one page holds everything design. So I included those features in the site.

Additionally, I talked to both types of users for the site and here's what I found:

* As a huge fan of Kermit and the Frogs, I want to be able to access their music, show times, and social links all in one place. I'd also like to be able to learn about the members, so a bio would be nice.
* As a member of the band, I want the fans to be able to have everything they need in one place. I would also like fans to be able to sign up for our newsletter so they can keep up with our lastest news easily.

Here are some links to the wireframes that I drew up during the design process:
