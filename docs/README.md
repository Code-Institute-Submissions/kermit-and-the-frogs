# Kermit and the Frogs

Kermit and the Frogs have been a worldwide sensation ever since the release of their album 'Down on the Street' earlier this year. Their universal style and ethnic blends have created an unprecendented demand for their music, as age groups all over the world are clamoring for content. Thus, this project was born.

People from all over world need somewhere to go to easily access the heralded music of Kermit and the Frogs, and this site does just that. It's a go to hub for all of their social links, newsletter signup, updates on shows, music samples, and even member bios so people can learn more about their favorite band.

## UX

This site is specifically for fans of Kermit and the Frogs who want easy access to their music. It should be easy and uncomplicated to find, visually appealing, and informative.

To get some ideas of concepts, I referenced one of my favorite artist's site, Jon Bellion: [Jon Bellion's Website](http://www.jonbellion.com/)

I appreciate the site's uniform design, fixed background image, one page holds everything design. So I included those features in the site.

Design Features Include:
    
* Pangolin font, which I find to mimic chalk on a chalkboard. It's clear, and appeals to a younger auidence.
* Fixed striking hero image which provides contrast and visual appeal.

Additionally, I talked to both types of users for the site and here's what I found:

* User Stories - Fan of the Band
    * As a fan of Kermit and the Frogs, I want to be able to access their music, and social links all in one place.
    * As a fan of Kermit and the Frogs, I want to be able to get updates as to where they are playing next.
    * As a fan of Kermit and the Frogs, I'd like to be able to learn about the members, so a bio for each member would be nice.
    
* User Stories - Member of the Band
    * As a member of the band, I want the fans to be able to have everything they need in one place, like social links and music.
    * As a member of the band, I would like fans to be able to sign up for our newsletter so they can keep up with our latest news and showtimes.
    * As a member of the band, I want people to be able to have people learn more about us, so a section that has a little about us would be nice.

* User Stories - Creator of the Site
    * As the creator of the site, I want the people who use this site to find it both visually appealing and resourceful.
    * As the creator of the site, I want users to be able to feel connected to the band, so bios and social links are important.
    * As the creator of the site, I want users to want to return to the site to get updates on the band and when they are playing next.

Here are some links to the wireframes that I drew up during the design process:
